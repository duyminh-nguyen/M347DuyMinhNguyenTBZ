## A) Learning Terms and Concepts
1. Difference between Pods and Replicas
In Kubernetes, Pods are the smallest units, each capable of containing one or more containers. Replicas are rules that ensure a certain number of these Pods are always active to maintain the stability and availability of an application.

2. Difference between Service and Deployment
A Service in Kubernetes is a stable address that allows other parts of the application to communicate with a group of Pods without knowing their exact locations. It also distributes network traffic to the Pods.

A Deployment controls how Pods are created and updated. It enables making changes to the running application, such as adding or replacing Pods, without causing downtime to the application.

3. What problem does Ingress solve?
In Kubernetes, Ingress functions like a gateway that directs external traffic into the cluster. It routes incoming requests based on defined rules to the corresponding services in the cluster, eliminating the need for individual public IP addresses and ports for each service.

4. What is a StatefulSet used for?
A StatefulSet in Kubernetes is used for applications that need to store persistent data, such as user logins or messages. It ensures that this data remains intact even during restarts or migrations within the cluster.
